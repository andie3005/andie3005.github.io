            So for some brief info about me and this page, I'm Andrea and the initiall motivation was to have somewhere to display 
            a small portfolio of my photos (mostly nature-based) and perhaps also chuck my cv somewhere in there/in the mix too and just have 
            everything all in one place. However as opposed to just using a website builder, I thought I'd try my hand at creating my own page/website 
            from scratch/the ground up and expand my knowledge and horizons and just have everything all in one place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from my meagre photography portfolio, I thought I'd also add a bit of an 'About Me' and 'CV' section.
            (That's what people do, right?)
        </p>
        <p>
            Also at the bottom of each page you should find a bunch of (hopefully functioning) links to various social media and platforms where 
            you can feel free to stalk me a bit further uh I mean learn more about me? If that's what you're after?

        <p>Write a brief introduction about yourself here.</p>
        <p>
            TLDR: Dog mom, biologist, and ex-swimmer, currently running on caffeine. 
            I love sports, learning, and above all, challenges! Failing? Not so much. 
            To me, anything worth doing is worth doing well.

        <p>
            See/get an idea of what I get up to. I've gathered a small snippet of some of my favorite shots below. 
            Feel free to check them out (here - insert link to portfolio) along with a list of my equipment so far. 
            Granted, it's mostly plant-based (but you won't find me going on about veganism), with some sea, sunset, and other random shots. 
            Hopefully, my photos will make you feel something â€” laughter, wonder, or the sudden urge to grab your own camera and start snapping.
