            Hi, I'm Andrea! This website's initial motivation was to display a small portfolio 
            of my photos (mostly nature-based) and include my CV. Rather than using a website builder, 
            I decided to create this from scratch to expand my knowledge and horizons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from my photography portfolio, I've included an "About Me" and "CV" section. 
            (That's what people do, right?)
        </p>
        <p>
            At the bottom of each page, you'll find (hopefully functioning) links to various social media 
            platforms where you can learn more about me.
        </p>

        <p>Write a brief introduction about yourself here.</p>
        <p>
            TLDR: Dog mom, biologist, and ex-swimmer, currently running on caffeine. 
            I love sports, learning, and above all, challenges! Failing? Not so much. 
            To me, anything worth doing is worth doing well.

        <p>Include your CV details here.</p>
        <p>
            If you're still here and want to know more about me, check out my CV for details 
            about my life as a biologist, ecologist, and scientist.

            Here's a snippet of some of my favorite shots. Feel free to explore 
            (insert link to portfolio) along with a list of my equipment. Most of my shots are nature-based, 
            featuring plants, sunsets, and sea views. Hopefully, my photos will inspire or evoke 
            something â€” whether it's laughter, wonder, or the urge to grab a camera and start snapping.
